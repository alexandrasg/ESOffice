									<h3>Adult Program</h3>

									<p>
										Adults pay on a per class basis and can either pay a single class, drop-in rate or purchase classes in bulk. Bulk classes/class cards allow for discounted classes but the student must have an active registration.  Registration fees are paid on an annual basis and expire one year from date of purchase.
									</p>

									<p>Basic pricing is as follows:

									<h3>Young Dancer Program</h3>

<p>Young Dancer classes run from September to the beginning of June and are paid for either in full at the beginning of the season or in ~10 week installments. An annual registration fee is paid separately in order to enroll and the total cost is determined based on the number and level of classes taken.  Tuition is discounted 5% if the season is paid in full and all parents are required to have payment information stored in MindBody so eXit SPACE can use autopayments to charge tuition.
</p>

<p> To apply the discounts, always order the classes from most expensive to least expensive and then apply the discount to each class as appropriate.<br><br>
	Siblings will be set up the same -- multiple classes are discounted accordingly -- and the 10% is then taken off each class.<br><br>
	Each sibling is discounted 10%. There is no "extra" discount for extra siblings.<br><br>
	Program Tuition and Scholarships are separate and are managed by Marlo.
