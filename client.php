									<p>The customer account is one of the main areas we work in.</p>

									<h3>Customer Lookup</h3>
									<p>To find a customer do one of the following:
										<ul class="client">
											<li>Start typing the customer name name in the search bar in the upper left corner ("Search for or jump to a client").<br><span class="image fit"><img style="max-width: 350px;" src="images/clientLookup1.jpg" alt="" /></span><br>If there is a match, you will see a list of names or the single name.  Use the mouse to highlight the customer and click.  You will be taken to their home page.</li>
											<li>If you are already on a client home page, use the search above the client name. <br><span class="image fit"><img style="max-width: 590px;" src="images/clientLookup2.jpg" alt="" /></span><br> You can enter full or partial information and will be taken to a list where you can select the client or to the client home page depending on the degree of matching for the search.</li>
											<li>If you can't find a match for the customer check that they aren't inactive by using the advanced client lookup.  You can access this from the top left search. <br><span class="image fit"><img style="max-width: 350px;" src="images/clientLookup3.jpg" alt="" /></span><br> Once in the search screen, under "Client info" set the second select to "Inactive clients" and then enter their name in the search field.  If there is a match, you can click on the client name to go to their profile.  To re-activate the client you will need to go into their profile and click on the Activate button at the top right (across from their name).</li>
									</p>
									<h3>Customer Creation</h3>
									<p>If you need to create a customer there are three ways:
										<ul class="client">
											<li>You can select add new client when using the search in the upper left (see above image). You will get a pop up that allows to add information (or it will be populated with what you had entered in the search). Fill in the name and then click "Create."<br><span class="image fit"><img style="max-width: 345px;" src="images/clientCreate1.jpg" alt="" /></span><br>Click on the "Customer Lookup" Tab to go to the new profile.</li>
										<li>If you are on a customer home page, there is an "Add New Client" button to the right of the search screen (see image above)
										</li>
										<li>From the point of sale screen there is also an "Add New Client" blutton<br><span class="image fit"><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="images/clientCreate2.jpg" alt="" /></span><br> This will open an inline form to add minimal information <br><span class="image fit"><img style="max-width: 600px;" src="images/clientCreate3.jpg" alt="" /></span><br></li>
