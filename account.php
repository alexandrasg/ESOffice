									<p>The client profile contains the personal information for the customer.  This is where you will add the data from the registration form that is filled out for either the young dancer or adult programs.  <br><br>
									For the young dancer program, the profile is under the student's name, not the parent.<br><br>
									To enter data, click on the area and it will open inline to provide the form fields.  We generally use the following areas for data:
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Edit Name</strong></li>
										<li><strong>Phone #</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless noted, primary phone on our reg form goes in the mobile phone field.</li>
										<li><strong>Address</strong></li>
										<li><strong>Email/Login</strong>
											<ul>
												<li>If the customer has filled out their profile online or created a password for their account, the password field will be filled in.  DON'T TOUCH IT!</li>
												<li>You can send the customer an email by clicking the envelope beside the email address.</li>
												<li>Try to make sure the customer gives an email address and be careful with data entry as this is where receipts for purchases are sent and it is our primary/preferred mode of contact.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Additional Information</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Birthdate and gender</li>
										<li><strong>Measurements</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use this for YDP costumes</li>

											<ul>
												<li>Use this to store a customer's credit card</li>

												<li>Info to collect when keying in data is number, exp date, name and zip</li>
												<li>If CC info is on file, <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">CC</span> shows up by the Billing Info header and also in the point of sale screen by their name.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Relationships</strong>
											<ul>
												<li>Primarily used to connect siblings for YDP.</li>

												<li>To assign: Click on Relationships, click on assign.  Type in the name of the related person to search.  You will need to select from a list if the system doesn't find an exact match. Choose the type of relationship from the select box and add relationship.
											</ul>
										</li>

											</ul>
										</li>
