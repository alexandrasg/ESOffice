										<h2>Customer Accounts:  Client Profile</h2>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/clientProfile.png" alt="" /></span>

									<p>The client profile contains the personal information for the customer.  If a customer creates their profile online, this information will be filled in.  For a paper registration, this is where you will add the data from the registration form that is filled out for either the young dancer or adult programs.<br><br>
									For the young dancer program, the profile is under the student's name, not the parent.<br><br>
									To enter or update data, click on the area and it will open inline to provide the form fields.  We generally use the following areas for data:
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Edit Name</strong></li>
										<li><strong>Contact</strong>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Email/Login</strong>
													<ul>
														<li>If the customer has filled out their profile online or created a password for their account, the password field will be filled in.  DON'T TOUCH IT!</li>
														<li>You can send the customer an email by clicking the envelope beside the email address.</li>
														<li>Try to make sure the customer gives an email address and be careful with data entry as this is where receipts for purchases are sent and it is our primary/preferred mode of contact.</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
												<li><strong>Phone numbers</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless noted, primary phone on our reg form goes in the mobile phone field.
												</li>
											</ul>

										<li><strong>Additional Information</strong>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Birthdate and gender</strong></li>
												<li><strong>Liability Waiver</strong><br>This will either show a date when the customer signed the waiver online or there will be a link to print the liability waiver.  Check the documents for the customer's waiver.  If there isn't one, print and have them sign it then scan and upload to their documents.  Once that is complete, click on Customer Indexes > Assign, switch Release form on File to Yes and submit.</li>
											</ul>

											</ul>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Relationships</strong>
											<ul>
												<li>Primarily used to connect siblings for YDP.</li>
												<li>Header will show a number in parentheses if relationships exist (customer home page also displays any relationships with links to the related party's profile).  Click on the header to show detail</li>
												<li>To assign: Click on Relationships, click on assign.  Type in the name of the related person to search.  You will need to select from a list if the system doesn't find an exact match. Choose the type of relationship from the select box and add relationship.</li>
												<li>As of fall summer 2018, when online enrollment was introduced, the standard Mindbody relationships are mostly inactive for our use so we can keep YDP payments and profiles working independently for each dancer. The relationships available should be ESSibling and ESParent</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Emergency Contact Information</strong>
											<ul>
												<li>For all YDP dancers, this should be populated with the parent name, the primary phone number and email</li>

												<li>Click on Customer Indexes, then click on Assign.  Set the appropriate values from the drop-down selections and click Update.</li>
